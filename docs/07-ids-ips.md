Following the implementation of logging and intrusion detection mechanisms, a
subsequent Lynis audit was performed. The improved score reflects the addition of
monitoring and detection capabilities rather than further configuration hardening.

Although the Lynis score increased after the introduction of monitoring and
intrusion detection mechanisms, the underlying system hardening remained
unchanged. This highlights that Lynis primarily measures the presence of
security controls rather than their operational effectiveness.
